# FIRST KEY CONCEPT: Mean and Variation.

In this study, we want to show two important things about flight prices in the U.S:

- What is the **mean price** (the average price) of a flight between two states.
- We want to show how stable these prices are — in other words, to show their **variation**.

### Mean

The **mean** is very simple: it’s just the **average price** you would expect to pay if you buy many flights on a route.

Imagine you took several flights between California and Texas.
One flight may cost $100, another $120, another $80.
If you add them up and divide that by how many flights you had, you get the mean — **the "typical" price** for the flights.

But wait — not all flights cost the same, sometimes you're paying much more than the average! Also, different routes can have differences in the variation of prices, even if their average fares are identical!

### Variation

Flight prices don’t always stick to the average. Sometimes they’re cheaper, sometimes more expensive. We call this how much prices vary around the mean.

**Low variation** means that prices are similar and stable.

**High variation** means that prices jump all over the place — sometimes they are cheap, sometimes expensive.

We measure those variations using a statistic called “standard deviation,” but no worries—you don’t need to remember the term or understand the math. Just know that looking at both the mean and the variation tells you the approximate range where flight prices tend to fall.

##### Example:

Suppose we compare two routes. California - Nevada (mean price: $100, variation: $50) and New York - Pennsylvania (mean price: $100, variation: $5). Even thought both routes have the same mean, flight prices behave differently:

- California - Nevada: **variation is high**, some flights cost **$50, some $100, some $150!**
- New York - Pennsylvania: **variation is low**, most flights cost something like **$95, $100, $105.**

So even if two pairs of states have the **same average price**, one might be very **predictable** and the other very **unpredictable.**
